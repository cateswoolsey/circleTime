# Project 01 - Timepiece


## Interpretation Guide
The piece represents the passage of time through expanding, glowing ripples that change in color and size depending on the current time. Ripples (ellipses) appear randomly on the canvas every second and their colors shift through a rainbow spectrum (whose hue ranges are also random) every 10 seconds. This means that while individual seconds can be counted (by seeing a new ripple appear on screen), every time the ranbow spectrum is fully cycled through, the user also knows that its been a minute (6 colors, 10 seconds each -- therefore 1 minute). The size of each ripple is proportional to the hour of the day -- showing how mornings can start off slow, but get a little more active as the day progresses. Ripples fade out and glow as they expand, which I hoped would symbolize time passing and is not something that lasts forever.
