# Reflection

- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
I would say the most difficult part about this assignment was ensuring that each second/hour lined up properly with what I wanted them to (math had to be correct, or else time wouldn't have been depicted accurately). Another thing that I found diffiuclt when coding was creating the ripple/glow effect -- Before experimenting, I found it difficult how I wanted to set up a for loop to create numerous rings and alter how they appear as they grow in size. While these were technical things that I struggled with, such as matching time up with color and the proportion of each ripple, I also think there were moments I struggled creatively. It took me a while how I wanted to incorperate time into this piece (apart from just having new ellipses appear every new second).

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
While I am happy with my piece, I still wonder if there are ways for me to incorperate months/years into how I show time. While I think that I show seconds and minutes in a creative manner, I also wonder if my representation of hours can be made more clear to the viewer (while its obvious that at the end of the day the ellipses get bigger, it is not something that is noticiable right away). 

- What questions (if any) do you have about this assignment?
This is not a question necessarily about the assignment as a whole, but more of a personal one based on my project -- do you see any ways for me to better represnt hours, as well as work on incorperating months/years into my piece?

During feedback in class, people also appreciated the random aspect. I am also interested in how to define randomness in my piece (for example, is it too chaotic? or make it seem as if theres a lack of agency with the piece?)
